<p>Gathering and extracting sufficient cytology image data for the project was a challenging step due to the lack of publicly available images, slides, and online microscopes.</p>

<h2 id="first-idea">First Idea</h2>

<p>The original idea was to use my own data, given my direct access to it as a professional in the field. However, the process of manually selecting and capturing the images using my phone camera and microscope proved to be time-consuming and would have necessitated extensive preprocessing. This was not the best approach for an ambitious three-week project.</p>

<p>Another option I considered was using images from book atlases and other resources I had accumulated over my years of practice. While these images provided a potential solution, their limited variety and quantity posed challenges for training a robust model.</p>

<h2 id="final-idea">Final Idea</h2>

<p>Ultimately, a breakthrough idea came from one of my best friends and colleagues, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xose-fern%C3%A1ndez-5a8064a3?originalSubdomain=es">Xose FernÃ¡nndez</a>, a fellow Cytotechnologist and Cytology Professor. He granted me access to an online microscope they use for teaching purposes, with a diverse range of scanned slides featuring different organs and diagnoses. After conducting research on their platform, I identified the organs and diagnoses that could provide the most data.</p>

<p>My initial data collection focused primarily on salivary gland samples, given the rich archive of slides and diagnostic diversity. Using my domain knowledge, I manually selected the fields of interest, employing the criteria used in Cytopathology for diagnosis. For instance, in the case of a Warthin Tumor, it was important to identify features such as a "dirty background" with lymphocytes and oncocytic cells.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, the available data was still limited. To address this challenge, I used data augmentation techniques in Python to generate synthetic images, thereby augmenting the training and validation datasets.</p>

<h2 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>

<p>Due to privacy concerns, I did not upload the final image folders to GitHub. Although ethical guidelines within academic cytology societies (of which I am a member) permit the use of individual images for research, education, and promoting cytology, strict protocols are followed in the medical community to ensure confidentiality and anonymity.</p>
