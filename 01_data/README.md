# ðŸ’» About the Data

## Binary Classification
* Effusions I: The effusions dataset was provided by [WellGen Medical](https://www.wellgen.info/en-home) a Digital Pathology company that offers Cytology solutions (scanning and AI algorithms). All samples are stained with Papanicolau.
* Effusions II: The following dataset was found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmacus/body-cavity-fluid-cytology-images) and contains an imbalance data of body cavity fluid cytology (effusions), all samples are Leishman stained.
* Blood Smears: The following dataset was found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmacus/malaria-parasite-in-blood-smears) and contains various cytological images of blood smears with malaria and no-malaria.

## Multiclassification
* Thyroid: The thyroid dataset was provided by [SYNLAB](https://www.synlab.com/lab/645). An excel file was provided along with different cytological samples for educational/academic purposes.
