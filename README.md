## About the Project
Primary Objective:
<ul>
  <li>Develop a multiple multi-classification models capable of diagnosing cytological image samples from diverse locations, including salivary glands, gynecological, thyroid, bone, lymph nodes, soft tissues, pancreas, bronchial washings, urine, and effusions.</li>
</ul>

Secondary Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Implement a web-based application using Streamlit that enables users to predict diagnoses based on their image-inputs.</li>
  <li>Provide informative feedback on the image features using ChatGPT API.</li>
</ul>

This project started on 08/07/2023 and was completed within 3 weeks, presented on 27/07/2023 for IronhackÂ´s final bootcamp project.

## Cytology, Cytopathology & Digital Pathology
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cytology</strong>: Cytology is the study of individual cells to detect abnormalities, including cancer. It provides a less invasive alternative to biopsies, thus enabling early diagnosis and treatment initiation.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Pathology</strong>: Digital pathology involves digitizing pathology slides, which allows the use of image-based information for diagnosis, research, and teaching. Despite its growth, this field faces significant challenges, particularly regarding the large sizes of image data and the computational and storage resources required.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenges in Cytology</strong>: Unlike tissue pathology, where cells maintain their original three-dimensional structure, cytology specimens are usually smears or suspensions of individual cells. This loss of the third dimension information can complicate diagnosis. Additionally, cytology is often less explored in the digital domain due to the complexities associated with digitizing three-dimensional images and the increased storage demands.</li>
    <li><strong>Cytopathology</strong>: Cytopathology is a branch of pathology that studies diseases on a cellular level. The role of a cytopathologist often extends to include interpretation and diagnosis based on these cellular studies.</li>
    <li><strong>Cytotechnologists</strong>: Cytotechnologists are key members of the cytology team. They are skilled professionals who screen cytologic preparations and often play a significant role in the initial interpretation of the specimens. The responsibilities of cytotechnologists may vary depending on the healthcare setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my professional experience, I've performed tasks that span screening, interpretation, and diagnosis of various cytology specimens, quality assurance, and teaching. This broad range of activities has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both the potential and challenges inherent in cytology and cytopathology.</p>

<p>This project aims to bridge the gap between cytology and digital pathology. We believe that machine and deep learning models can be effectively applied to cytology data, thus highlighting the value of cytology professionals and promoting the field.</p>

## Project development:
**Start:** 08/07/23 - **Deadline:** 29/07/23

* 08/07/23: Data collection and defining the challenge. Also, run a first quick model with an effusion dataset.
* 09/07/23: Cleaned an excel file with Cytology data from my work.
* 10/07/23: Created basic structure of folders, README in GitHub. Struggling with my Data gathering.
* 11-13/07/23: Found new sources of Data, cleaned the code for multiclassification, ran a first script using salivary gland specimens.
* 15/07/23: Documenting the process in the README files, getting in touch with fellow colleagues (cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, professors) to get new insights and cross-validation of the images.
