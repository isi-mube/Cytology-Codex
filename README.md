## About the Project
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of this <strong>project</strong> is to do various classifications of cytological image samples from different locations (effusions, breast, bone, thyroid...) and diagnose them as cancer or not, and in some instances doing an specific diagnose.
</p>

## Digital Cytology
* Explain briefly what Cytology is
* Explain briefly what Digital Pathology is
* Explain briefly problems that Cytology faces

## Project development:
**Start:** 08/07/23
**Deadline:** 29/07/23
* 08/07/23: Data collection and defining the challenge. Also, run a first quick model with the efussion dataset.
* 09/07/23:
  * SQL: Cleaned the Excel file. Selected some thyroid samples to scan.
* 10/07/23:
  * README: Files updated for main, data and python scripts folders.
  * Effusion dataset: Trying to solve the issue of pre-processing images. Contacted with WellGen, got a code from Computer Vision forum to clean blank spaces and crop the images based on clusters.

## Model Results

## Toolkit:

* **JupyterLab**: Enviorment for Python scripts and managing files.

**Libraries**

* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Numpy**: Arrays and mathematical functions.
* **Os**: File managment.
* **Warnings**: Roses are red, violets are blue --> Warnings are annoying.
