## About the Project
<h2>Primary Objective:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a multi-classification model capable of diagnosing cytological image samples from diverse locations, including salivary glands, gynecological, thyroid, bone, lymph nodes, soft tissues, pancreas, bronchial washings, urine, and effusions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Secondary Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a web-based application using Streamlit that enables users to predict diagnoses based on their image-inputs.</li>
  <li>Provide informative feedback on the image features using LLM (Large Language Model).</li>
</ul>

## Digital Cytology
* Explain briefly what Cytology is
* Explain briefly what Digital Pathology is
* Explain briefly problems that Cytology faces

## Project development:
**Start:** 08/07/23
**Deadline:** 29/07/23
* 08/07/23: Data collection and defining the challenge. Also, run a first quick model with the efussion dataset.
* 09/07/23:
  * SQL: Cleaned the Excel file. Selected some thyroid samples to scan.
* 10/07/23:
  * README: Files updated for main, data and python scripts folders.
  * Effusion dataset: Trying to solve the issue of pre-processing images. Contacted with WellGen, got a code from Computer Vision forum to clean blank spaces and crop the images based on clusters.

* **JupyterLab**: Enviorment for Python scripts and managing files.

**Libraries**

* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Numpy**: Arrays and mathematical functions.
* **Os**: File managment.
* **Warnings**: Roses are red, violets are blue --> Warnings are annoying.
