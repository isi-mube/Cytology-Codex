## About the Project
Primary Objective:
<ul>
  <li>Develop a multiple multi-classification models capable of diagnosing cytological image samples from diverse locations, including salivary glands, gynecological, thyroid, bone, lymph nodes, soft tissues, pancreas, bronchial washings, urine, and effusions.</li>
</ul>

Secondary Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Implement a web-based application using Streamlit that enables users to predict diagnoses based on their image-inputs.</li>
  <li>Provide informative feedback on the image features using ChatGPT API.</li>
</ul>

This project started on 08/07/2023 and was completed within 3 weeks, presented on 27/07/2023 for IronhackÂ´s final bootcamp project.

## About Cytology
### Glossary
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cytology</strong>: Cytology is the study of individual cells to detect abnormalities, including cancer. It provides a less invasive alternative to biopsies, thus enabling early diagnosis and treatment initiation.</li>

  <small><em>George Papanicolaou was a Greek-American cytologist born on May 13, 1883, renowned for developing the Pap smear test, which is extensively used worldwide for the detection and prevention of cervical cancer and other cytological diseases.</em></small>
</p>
  <br>
    <li><strong>Cytopathology</strong>: Cytopathology is a branch of pathology that studies diseases on a cellular level. Professionals of cytopathology include Cytotechnologists & Cytopathologists, for screening, interpretation, and diagnosis of diverse cell samples.</li>
  <br>
    <li><strong>Digital Pathology</strong>: Digital pathology involves digitizing pathology slides, which allows the use of image-based information for diagnosis, research, and teaching. Despite its growth, this field faces significant challenges, particularly regarding the large sizes of image data and the computational and storage resources required.</li>
</ul>

  <br>
  <small><em>Digital Pathology includes not only the digitalization of histology and cytology slides but also the automatization, technology, and tools of all preanalytical, analytical and post analytical processes in a pathology department.</em></small>

### Challenges in Digital Cytology
Unlike histology where cells maintain their original three-dimensional structure in a thin and flat layer, cytology samples aren't one-dimensional, generally comprising smears or suspensions of unique configurations of individual cells that no longer hold their original formation. This additional third dimension makes diagnosis more complex and time-consuming as it requires mastery of pattern recognition. Furthermore, digital exploration in cytology is relatively new due to the challenges involved in digitizing three-dimensional images and the resulting increased storage requirements.

### Personal involvement 
As a Cytotechnologist, Cytology Professor, and Digital Pathology Specialist my work has involved screening, and diagnosis of numerous cytology specimens, quality control, and engaging in both teaching and research. Using my field knowledge and expertise, my project also aims to build a nexus between Cytology and Digitalisation. I am convinced that Machine Learning and Deep Learning models can be successfully implemented in Cytology for Data Analysis, bypassing the need for a complete scan.

## Project development:
**Start:** 08/07/23 - **Deadline:** 29/07/23

* 08/07/23: Data collection and defining the challenge. Also, run a first quick model with an effusion dataset.
* 09/07/23: Cleaned an excel file with Cytology data from my work.
* 10/07/23: Created basic structure of folders, README in GitHub. Struggling with my Data gathering.
* 11-13/07/23: Found new sources of Data, cleaned the code for multiclassification, ran a first script using salivary gland specimens.
* 15/07/23: Documenting the process in the README files, getting in touch with fellow colleagues (cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, professors) to get new insights and cross-validation of the images.
