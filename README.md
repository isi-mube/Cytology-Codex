## About the Project
Primary Objective:
<ul>
  <li>Develop a multiple multi-classification models capable of diagnosing cytological image samples from diverse locations, including salivary glands, gynecological, thyroid, bone, lymph nodes, soft tissues, pancreas, bronchial washings, urine, and effusions.</li>
</ul>

Secondary Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Implement a web-based application using Streamlit that enables users to predict diagnoses based on their image-inputs.</li>
  <li>Provide informative feedback on the image features using ChatGPT API.</li>
</ul>

This project started on 08/07/2023 and was completed within 3 weeks, presented on 27/07/2023 for IronhackÂ´s final bootcamp project.

## Cytology, Cytopathology & Digital Pathology
* Explain briefly what Cytology is
* Explain briefly what Digital Pathology is
* Explain briefly problems that Cytology faces

## Project development:
**Start:** 08/07/23 - **Deadline:** 29/07/23

* 08/07/23: Data collection and defining the challenge. Also, run a first quick model with an effusion dataset.
* 09/07/23: Cleaned an excel file with Cytology data from my work.
* 10/07/23: Created basic structure of folders, README in GitHub. Struggling with my Data gathering.
* 11-13/07/23: Found new sources of Data, cleaned the code for multiclassification, ran a first script using salivary gland specimens.
* 15/07/23: Documenting the process in the README files, getting in touch with fellow colleagues (cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, professors) to get new insights and cross-validation of the images.
